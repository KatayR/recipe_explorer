  /// Progressive preloading algorithm documentation.
  /// 
  /// This system uses scroll-based progressive loading to eliminate blank image
  /// blocks during fast scrolling while maintaining memory efficiency.
  /// 
  /// ## Algorithm Steps:
  /// 
  /// ### 1. GET SCROLL POSITION
  /// - `scrollOffset`: Current scroll position in pixels from top
  /// - `maxScrollExtent`: Total scrollable distance in pixels
  /// 
  /// ### 2. CONVERT TO PERCENTAGE
  /// - `scrollPercentage = scrollOffset / maxScrollExtent`
  /// - Examples: 0.0 = top, 0.5 = middle, 1.0 = bottom
  /// 
  /// ### 3. MAP TO ITEM INDEX
  /// - `currentItemIndex = (scrollPercentage * totalItems).floor()`
  /// - Examples with 36 items:
  ///   - scrollPercentage 0.0 ‚Üí viewing item 0
  ///   - scrollPercentage 0.5 ‚Üí viewing item 18
  ///   - scrollPercentage 0.8 ‚Üí viewing item 28
  /// 
  /// ### 4. CALCULATE 20-AHEAD TARGET
  /// - `targetPreloadCount = (currentItemIndex + 20).clamp(0, totalItems)`
  /// - Examples with 36 items:
  ///   - viewing item 0 ‚Üí preload to item 20
  ///   - viewing item 10 ‚Üí preload to item 30
  ///   - viewing item 25 ‚Üí preload to item 36 (clamped)
  /// 
  /// ### 5. ENFORCE 15-ITEM MINIMUM
  /// For early scrolling in long lists:
  /// - `proposedTarget = max(targetPreloadCount, 15)`
  /// - Examples:
  ///   - 100-item list, viewing item 0: target=20, keep 20 (‚â•15)
  ///   - 100-item list, viewing item 2: target=22, keep 22 (‚â•15)
  ///   - Short lists automatically clamped to list length anyway
  /// 
  /// ### 6. END-OF-LIST OPTIMIZATION
  /// If proposedTarget would leave ‚â§5 items remaining, preload everything:
  /// - Examples with 36 items:
  ///   - viewing item 10: target=30, remaining=6, preload to 30 (6>5)
  ///   - viewing item 15: target=35, remaining=1, preload all 36 (1‚â§5)
  ///   - viewing item 20: target=36, remaining=0, already at end
  /// 
  /// ### 7. SPAM PREVENTION
  /// Only trigger if we need ‚â•5 more items than currently preloaded.
